    From the desk of R. Justin Freeman: the blog for Letterswitch Publishing, a
    micropublisher on Nova Scotia's beautiful South Shore publishing books that
    encourage, educate, and entertain parents and kids. A repository for
    stories, musings, tips, tricks, and quips that I can't find any contrived
    means of jamming into a book.
