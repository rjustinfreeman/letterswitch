    From the desk of R. Justin Freeman: the blog for Letterswitch Publishing, a
    micropublisher on Nova Scotia's beautiful South Shore publishing books that
    encourage, educate, and entertain parents and kids. An unapologetically
    unorganized repository for stories, musings, tips, tricks, and quips that I
    can't find any contrived means of jamming into a book.{" "}
