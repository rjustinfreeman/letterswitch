Welcome to the blog for Letterswitch Publishing. You deeply honor me with your presence here, because it's most likely because you've seen other work I've done and have been interested enough to inquire further. The site as a whole will likely come to be as chaotic and lawless as my physical desktop tends to be; there will probably be a proper mish-mash of Letterswitch news, personal tidbits, parenting tips, behind the scenes glimpses, sneak peeks of projects in the pipeline, and musings I don't have a better place for. I'll do my best to wrangle similar posts together beneath tags you'll find at the bottom of the post pages, but no promises about my taxonomical skills.

If any of you have found me inscrutable, well, here's your antidotal anecdotals.
