<div class="lyrics">"Gratitude is the fairest blossom which springs from the soul."

Everyone's partner wants to know if their work and worth are valued by the person they're doing life with - and they won't know if you don't tell them. It can be easy when something is so patently obvious to you for it to escape mention - you may feel so certain of your affection for your partner, commenting on it can feel like remarking on the blueness of the sky. As much as it seems otherwise sometimes, though, your partner can't read your mind. Air your thoughts out on the clothesline here.

If you struggle with how to express yourself, frame how you're feeling in the context of a journalist question:

**Who:** "Every time I see someone with a sour look, it reminds me how nice your smile is."
**What:** "Your cooking is great, I'm glad I get to enjoy it."
**When:** "When I see you playing with the kids, I'm grateful they have you."
**Where:** "I can't look at that hospital without being thankful for you and the kids."
**Why:** "Sometimes I think about life in another context and am reminded of how grateful I am for this."
**How:** "I always feel close to you when you **\_ \_** **\_ **, thank you."

As with a lot of other things in life, the devil is in the details. If you want to improve lines of communication and feelings of intimacy with someone, be specific about the way they improve your life.
